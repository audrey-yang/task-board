## Description
Have you felt unproductive during quarantine? Need a quick organizational tool?

The Productivity Sticky Space is a simple productivity tool simulating a real board of sticky notes. You can generate different types of notes, such as a task note with a due date, a casual note, and a photo note. These notes can be dragged around and pinned down anywhere on the board, just like on a real bulletin board! You also have the option of using a bulletin board or a poster board.

## Implementation
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this app and hosted it using GitHub Pages.

## Known Bugs
The sticky notes disappear on a page refresh; however, the app is still usable without needing to refresh the page. Resizing an image is still a little funky, as the image will move a little while resizing if it is not pinned.

## Future Plans
Some possible changes to implement involve backend coding, including making the notes stick and sending out scheduled email/text reminders.
